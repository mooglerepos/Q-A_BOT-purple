    test = """The earliest known soil classification system comes from China, appearing in the book Yu Gong (5th century BCE), where the soil was divided into three categories and nine classes, depending on its color, texture and hydrology.Contemporaries Friedrich Albert Fallou, the German founder of modern soil science, and Vasily Dokuchaev, the Russian founder of modern soil science, are both credited with being among the first to identify soil as a resource whose distinctness and complexity deserved to be separated conceptually from geology and crop production and treated as a whole. As a founding father of soil science Fallou has primacy in time. Fallou was working on the origins of soil before Dokuchaev was born, however Dokuchaev's work was more extensive and is considered to be the more significant to modern soil theory than Fallou's.Previously, soil had been considered a product of chemical transformations of rocks, a dead substrate from which plants derive nutritious elements. Soil and bedrock were in fact equated. Dokuchaev considers the soil as a natural body having its own genesis and its own history of development, a body with complex and multiform processes taking place within it. The soil is considered as different from bedrock. The latter becomes soil under the influence of a series of soil-formation factors (climate, vegetation, country, relief and age). According to him, soil should be called the daily or outward horizons of rocks regardless of the type; they are changed naturally by the common effect of water, air and various kinds of living and dead organisms.A 1914 encyclopedic definition:the different forms of earth on the surface of the rocks, formed by the breaking down or weathering of rocks. serves to illustrate the historic view of soil which persisted from the 19th century. Dokuchaev's late 19th century soil concept developed in the 20th century to one of soil as earthy material that has been altered by living processes. A corollary concept is that soil without a living component is simply a part of earth's outer layer.Further refinement of the soil concept is occurring in view of an appreciation of energy transport and transformation within soil. The term is popularly applied to the material on the surface of the Earth's moon and Mars, a usage acceptable within a portion of the scientific community. Accurate to this modern understanding of soil is Nikiforoff's 1959 definition of soil as the excited skin of the sub aerial part of the earth's crust.Areas of practice Academically, soil scientists tend to be drawn to one of five areas of specialization: microbiology, pedology, edaphology, physics, or chemistry. Yet the work specifics are very much dictated by the challenges facing our civilization's desire to sustain the land that supports it, and the distinctions between the sub-disciplines of soil science often blur in the process. Soil science professionals commonly stay current in soil chemistry, soil physics, soil microbiology, pedology, and applied soil science in related disciplines One interesting effort drawing in soil scientists in the USA as of 2004 is the Soil Quality Initiative. Central to the Soil Quality Initiative is developing indices of soil health and then monitoring them in a way that gives us long term (decade-to-decade) feedback on our performance as stewards of the planet. The effort includes understanding the functions of soil microbiotic crusts and exploring the potential to sequester atmospheric carbon in soil organic matter. The concept of agriculture in relation to soil quality, however, has not been without its share of controversy and criticism, including critiques by Nobel Laureate Norman Borlaug and World Food Prize Winner Pedro Sanchez.A more traditional role for soil scientists has been to map soils. Most every area in the United States now has a published soil survey, which includes interpretive tables as to how soil properties support or limit activities and uses. An internationally accepted soil taxonomy allows uniform communication of soil characteristics and soil functions. National and international soil survey efforts have given the profession unique insights into landscape scale functions.
    Soil Science has traditionally been an umbrella for soil physics, soil chemistry, soil microbiology, soil fertility, soil morphology, and soil technology. The area dealing with soils as entities in and of themselves has commonly been referred to as pedology (Arnold, 1983). Pedological activities in the United States have been prominent in the soil survey. The soil survey is the institutional construct that implements the concepts of the discipline of Pedology. After the land-grant colleges were authorized and charged with teaching agricultural knowledge, home economics, mechanic arts, and similar job training skills, the US Weather in 1894 created a Division of Agricultural Soils (Helms et al., 2002). A bit later agricultural experiment stations at those universities were federally funded and soon began the long-standing partnership of federal and state agencies and organizations. Since 1899 the partnership in soil surveys has been called the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS). When the Soil Conservation Service was formed in 1935 their soil surveys were primarily for privately owned farms rather than the county soil surveys of the National Soil Survey group. All of the soil information was provided without charge and that is true today.The mission of the NCSS has always been to help others better understand soils and use them wisely (Ableiter, 1938). This suggests that first one must know something about soil; what they are, how to recognize them, where they are, how and when they are formed, how they function, and their qualities and suitability. During attempts to learn and inform others about what had been discovered, there was awareness of the fragility of soil ecosystems and how human survival has been influenced by the improper functioning and use of the ecosystems (Lowdermilk, 1953). Consequently it became important to save these resources and use them wisely.There are many perceptions and even definitions of what pedology is and has been (Brevik et al., 2015b). In the United States there is a century plus of events, personalities, results, and opinions of what happened and is happening. For me the driving force behind this history has been the positive attitudes of pedologists about what they call soils. To observe, study, model, and delineate similarities on maps is exhilarating. It is something real; it is not menial work; it is exciting and important, yet the details are mostly unknown. I like this quote of Werner Heisenberg, a theoretical physicist, “What we observe is not nature herself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning.”Why perspectives about soil survey? For me they are evaluations of relative significance because we speculate about what we observe, describe, measure, and integrate into models. Consequently perspectives are viewpoints about what and why we do what we do. I was impressed with articles by Kellogg (1959) and Cline (1961) because I felt I was being talked to.As a pedologist I believe that the truth is in the soil itself; it contains records of what happened. Most records are palimpsest where part of prior results are removed or erased and newer ones recorded over them. The real history of a soil is complex and not known with a high degree of certainty. Rather there are acceptable connections and relationships that enable us to think of soils as small individual volumes whose presence is a miniscule part of a continuum in space and time that is referred to as the pedosphere. Pedology is a subdiscipline of Soil Science; it is an interpretive venture into the existence of surficial earthy materials that we call as soils.It is a probabilistic world; all measurements contain uncertainty. Measurements do not include value judgments. Numbers to not care and soils do not care, people do. Quality is a value judgment about being meaningful and is subject to all the vagaries of human thought about values. The basis for judgment is purpose. There can be multiple judgments of the same relationships depending on the purposes. All of this is certainly true for Pedology, the philosophical core of Soil Science.
    When you stand in a field and look around, you see land surfaces, vegetation, sky, and maybe some human structures. We can’t see below the ground surface and really know what is there. Road cuts, quarry faces, and pipeline trenches permit us to see 2D patterns, which we also try to visualize as 3D images. In other places we dig pits and can see and touch textures, colors, layers, and other features, which we extrapolate as parts of our mental models of the soils and their variability in a limited space. We understand some places better than others. Developing working models of soil–landscape relationships is critical to extrapolating point observations to the features of landscapes.An interesting formulation of the thought processes in soil survey has been suggested by Bui (2004).Soils provide and support many interpretive functions in ecosystems. All soil functions are environmental because soils are integral parts of terrestrial ecosystems. Important ones include biomass transformations, partitioning of water, regulation of fluxes, providing habitats, and other uses. Each specific function of soil can be stated as a purpose for an individual or group of users.In 2001 the World Resource Institute noted that the challenge of civilization was to reconcile the demands of human development with the tolerances of nature. The Earth's capacity to produce food and other vital environmental functions under prevailing conditions is constrained by soil qualities, climatic conditions, and applied land management strategies. Yes, indeed, there are thresholds and limits!"""
